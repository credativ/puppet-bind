This is a template for a module in the style of most credativ modules.
It uses parameterized classes and params_lookup to support multiple backends
for parameters (e.g. included params file and hiera).

USAGE:
======
- Copy to a new folder called as the modulename you intend to use.
- Replace __module__ in manifests/*.pp and examples/* with the intended
  module name.
  Example:
  sed -i 's/__module__/your_intended_modulename/g' manifests/*.pp examples/*
- Edit and add files as you need
- Replace this README with your own README
